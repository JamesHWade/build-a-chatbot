## The Plan for Today

My plan is to talk as little as possible and let you all play with the tools. I'll give a brief overview of the tools and then we'll jump into an interactive workshop.

It may take a few minutes to setup your environment. The best way to do this is to clone this repo and open the project in RStudio. Here's a link to the repo: [chatgpt-copilot-r-workshop](https://github.com/jameshwade/chatgpt-copilot-r-workshop).

### Clone Workshop Materials

There are two easy ways to clone the repo. You can use RStudio built-in buttons or the `{usethis}` package.

### Interactive with RStudio

To clone the repo, open RStudio and go to `File > New Project > Version Control > Git` and paste in the following URL: <https://github.com/JamesHWade/chatgpt-copilot-r-workshop.git>.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Clone git repository with RStudio"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("media/clone-repo.png")
```

### Clone with `{usethis}`

You can also use the following code to clone the packages we'll be using today.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
# install.packages("usethis")
require(usethis)
create_from_github("jameshwade/chatgpt-copilot-r-workshop",
                   fork = FALSE)
```

:::

This repo uses `{renv}` to help create a reproducible environment. When you clone and open the package in RStudio, you should be prompted to install the packages.
