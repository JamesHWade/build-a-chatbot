## The Plan for Today

My plan is to talk as little as possible and let you all play with the tools. I'll give a brief overview of the tools and then we'll jump into an interactive workshop.

It may take a few minutes to setup your environment. The best way to do this is to clone this repo and open the project in RStudio. Here's a link to the repo: https://github.com/jameshwade/chatgpt-copilot-r-workshop.

You can also use the following code to install the packages we'll be using today.

```{r}


```{r}
1 + 1
```
